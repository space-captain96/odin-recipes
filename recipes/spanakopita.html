            <h4>Greek style spinach pie</h4>
            <p>
                This is a signature vegetarian Greek dish, Greek spinach
                pie, folded into large triangles per serving. Greek's love
                to make this for special occasions and for the people they 
                love.
            </p>
            <p>
                It used to be considered an exotic dish in the US, because the phyllo
                dough was very hard to find. You couldn't just go to any supermarket
                and expect to find the frozen dough. Now it has become more
                mainstream, thus the ingredents are now easier to find.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Prepare the Filling</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Wash and drain the chopped spinach very well.
                    If using frozen spinach, thaw completely and
                    squeeze out excess water. The spinach should
                    be dry before you begin cooking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat 1/2 cup of the olive oil in a deep saute pan
                    or large Dutch oven. Saute the onions and green
                    onions until tender.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the spinach, parsley, and dill, and cool for 5
                    to 10 minutes until the spinach is wilted and heated 
                    through.      
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. The 
                    spinach mixture should be on the dry side; if using 
                    frozen spinach, you will want to cook it until excess
                    moisture evaporates. Remove from the heat and set the
                    spinach mixture aside to cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large mixing bowl, combine the feta, eggs, and
                    ricotta cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the cooled spinach mixture and mix until combined.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Prepare the Phyllo</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Combine the melted butter with the olive oil in a bowl.
                    Using a pastry brush, lightly grease 2 (9 x 12-inch)
                    rectangular pans.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carefully remove the phyllo roll from the plastic sleeve.
                    Most packages come in 12 x 18-inch sheets when opened fully.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using kitchen scissors or a sharp knife, cut the sheets in half
                    to make 2 stacks of 9 X 12-inch sheets. To prevent drying, cover
                    1 stack with wax paper and a damp towel while working with the
                    other.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Making the Spanakopita</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 F. Layer about 10 sheets of phyllo on the 
                    bottom of each pan, making sure to brush each sheet with the
                    butter-olive oil mixture before layering the next.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add half of the spinach mixture to each pan in an even layer and 
                    press with a spatula to flatten.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Layer another 10 phyllo sheets on top of the spinach mixture in each
                    pan, making sure to brush each sheet well with the butter-olive oil 
                    mixture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Before baking, score the top layer of the phyllo to enable easier
                    cutting of pieces later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake until the pie turns a deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let cool for a few minutes and then slice, serve, and enjoy.
                </li>
            </ol>
